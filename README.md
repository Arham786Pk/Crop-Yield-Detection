🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning and Geospatial Data
This project focuses on predicting crop yields (in hg/ha) using historical agricultural, climatic, and geospatial data. It leverages machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and others to forecast yields based on features like temperature, rainfall, pesticide usage, crop type, and country/region.

📌 Key Features
📊 Supervised ML models for crop yield prediction

🌍 Geospatial integration: support for region-based predictions (e.g., using "Area" and "Item" as inputs)

🌦️ Inputs include:

Average rainfall

Pesticide usage

Mean temperature

Area (country/region)

Crop type

📈 Model comparison: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, and KNN

🧪 Interactive predictive system (user can test custom inputs)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (ML models, preprocessing)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

(Optional) GeoPandas, Rasterio (for future geospatial enhancement)
